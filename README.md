# DayPlanner

## Description

* The project builds upon starter code to create a single day calendar application.

* The calendar runs in the browser and utilizes HTML, CSS, jQuery and Moment.js library. 

* This calendar application is for a single day with standard business hours from 0900 to 1700. 

## Goals

* The goals of this project include the following:

    * The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

    * Single row time blocks for every hour from 0900 to 1700. 

    * Each time block is color coded to indicate if it is past (gray), present (red) or future time (green). 

    * When the user clicks into a time block, they are able to type an event.

    * When the user clicks the 'save' icon for that time block, the event is saved in local storage.

    * When the user refreshes the page, the event persists.
